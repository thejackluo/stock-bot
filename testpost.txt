Affirmative Action is certainly racism. If that's the limit of your view, this should be a very futile thread. But if part of your worldview is "this is racism and that's unacceptable," then the conversation is more interesting.

Colleges and workplaces may value diversity. There are some colleges and workplaces that don't value diversity, but their populations tend to devolve into completely homogeneous shitholes. Colleges and workplaces are thus incentive to cultivate a diverse environment to be more competitive in the marketplace.

But it's racist to treat people differently based on race. The trick is, you'll get a racist result anyway, if you never treat people differently based on race, because of racism in the past.

For example, say you have a college that doesn't let asian people in. Then one day, the college declares "We're opening admission to everyone. You'll be judged on a variety of racially equal factors, such as 'did your parents attend this school.'" If there was never any racism in the past, this would be fine. But because of the racist history of the school, Asians are going to be disproportionately discriminated against under the (currently) egalitarian admission policy. So they're going to be racist if they don't factor in race and they're going to be racist if they do factor in race.

In that situation, the organization is just going to do whatever adds the most value. It's a racism zero sum game where you are just unlucky.
